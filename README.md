# Logistic-Regression-Model
As a part of my learning process in data science and machine learning, I built this logistic regression model from scratch without relying on popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. The goal was to understand the underlying concepts and implement a predictive model using fundamental tools.

The project utilizes NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The model predicts whether a person has diabetes or not based on various input features.
